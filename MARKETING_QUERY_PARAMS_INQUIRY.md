# Query Parameters Inquiry for Marketing Team

**Subject:** Query Parameters Used on Blog Site (blog.uma.xyz)

Hi Marketing Team,

We're planning to implement query parameter restrictions on our blog site (blog.uma.xyz) to improve security and URL cleanliness. Before we proceed, we need to ensure we don't break any existing marketing tracking or analytics functionality.

**Could you please confirm:**
1. Are you currently using any query parameters on blog.uma.xyz for tracking marketing campaigns or analytics?
2. If yes, which specific query parameter names are you using?

**Common examples we're aware of:**
- UTM parameters (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, utm_content)
- Analytics tracking IDs (e.g., ref, source, gclid, fbclid)
- Campaign identifiers (e.g., campaign_id, campaign_name)
- Any custom tracking parameters specific to your tools

**Why we're asking:**
We want to whitelist any parameters you're actively using so your tracking continues to work seamlessly after we implement the restrictions.

Please let us know by [DATE] so we can proceed with the implementation.

Thanks!
