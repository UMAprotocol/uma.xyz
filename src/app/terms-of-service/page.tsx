        <P>
          These Terms of Service (the &quot;Agreement&quot; or the &apos;Terms&apos;) explain the terms and conditions
          by which you may access and use the Products provided by Risk Labs (referred to herein as &quot;Risk
          Labs&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot; or the &apos;Company&apos;). The products shall
          include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, http://uma.xyz, http://vote.uma.xyz, and
          http://oracle.uma.xyz (collectively, the &apos;Interfaces&apos; or the &apos;App&apos;) and all products and
          features available via the Interfaces, including all other software Risk Labs or a third party has developed
          on the Interfaces (collectively, the &apos;Products&apos;). You must read this Agreement carefully as it
          governs your use of the Products. By accessing or using any of the Products, you signify that you have read,
          understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not
          authorized to access or use any of our Products and should not use our Products. To access or use any of our
          Products, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are
          at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old in the United States) and have the full
          right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf
          of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Interface. If you are entering
          into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent to us that you have the legal authority to bind such
          entity. You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or
          enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties
          (including but not limited to the list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S.
          Department of the Treasury) (collectively, a &apos;Sanctioned Person&apos;) or (b) a resident, citizen or

          with any Sanctioned Person or any person present in a Restricted Territory. Finally, you represent that your
          access and use of any of our Products will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and that you

          circumvent, or attempt to circumvent, to circumvent any such jurisdictional restrictions is prohibited.
          NOTICE: This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration provision and a class
          action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. Our Products are only
          available to you, and you should only access any of our Products, if you agree completely with these terms.

        <H2>2. Our Services</H2>
        <H3>2.1 The Protocol and The Network</H3>
        <P>
          UMA is open-source software providing supportive infrastructure for contracts created by third parties. The
          UMA network oracle system consists of two core components: the Optimistic Oracle and the Data Verification
          Mechanism (“DVM”), (together the &quot;Network&quot;). The Network is used to facilitate determinations made
          with respect to decentralized finance (&quot;DeFi&quot;) contracts, or third party integrations using
          UMA&apos;s Network. The Interfaces provide a user-friendly way to interact with the UMA protocol. Risk Labs
          provides the Interfaces for convenience, but does not control the underlying blockchain transactions, any
          assets involved in these transactions, the terms of any contracts, or the outcomes of the Network. Risk Labs
          never takes possession of your assets or private keys at any point; the UMA protocol is and will remain
          non-custodial, meaning you alone control your crypto assets and transactions. Risk Labs does not claim
          ownership over the core UMA protocol or the data submitted to or returned by the Network - those are part of a
          public, decentralized network. All on-chain contributions and the outcomes determined by the Network are not
          within Risk Labs&apos; control. Risk Labs does not control the terms of any contract and does not approve,
          de-list, or otherwise monitor contracts that make use of the UMA Network. Risk Labs does not provide listings
          or offers of financial contracts linked to specified assets, and does not provide exchange or trading services
          of such contracts. Because UMA is decentralized and autonomous, Risk Labs does not guarantee or warrant the
          results provided by the Network. The outputs of the UMA protocol (such as the outcome of a vote on a data
          point) are generated by the collective actions of independent participants (UMA tokenholders) and the UMA
          protocol&apos;s code. Risk Labs has no ability to change, reverse, or invalidate any oracle outcome, smart
          contract action, or governance decision on the UMA protocol. You acknowledge that no one party (including Risk
          Labs) fully controls the UMA protocol, and that using UMA means accepting the risks of a decentralized
          infrastructure.
        </P>
        <H3>2.2 Your Acknowledgement of Information on the Interfaces</H3>
        <P>
          You hereby acknowledge and agree that all information on the Interfaces in connection with your access and use
          of the Interfaces is intended for informational purposes only. The Interfaces strive to provide accurate
          information, but there is no guarantee or warranty that the information is updated, complete, or timely. For
          this reason, you acknowledge and agree that you are not relying on any of the information on the Interface or
          any other App for any purpose and expressly (i) disclaim any reliance on any information on the Interfaces,
          and (ii) acknowledge that neither the Company nor UMA will be liable for the accuracy or reliability of any
          such information provided. From time to time the Interfaces or the features contained therein may be

          infrastructure delay, inaccessibility, or malfunctions; (B) periodic maintenance procedures or repairs that
          the Company or any of its suppliers or contractors may undertake from time to time; (C) causes beyond the
          Company&apos;s control or that the Company could not reasonably foresee; (D) disruptions and temporary or
          permanent unavailability of underlying blockchain infrastructure; or (E) unavailability of third-party service
          providers or external partners for any reason. You should take all steps to independently verify any
          information on the App and any Interfaces on which you intend to rely and should not take action based solely
          on any information contained on any Interfaces or other information provided by the Company, including blog
          posts, data, articles, links to third-party content, social media content (including Discord, Lens, Farcaster
          or X), news feeds, tutorials and videos. None of the information provided on any Interface, or through the app
          should be construed as professional or investment advice, and the Company does not owe any duties and does not
          have any obligations to you based on the information provided on the Site, any other Interfaces, or through
          the App or other means of disseminating information. You acknowledge and agree that all information provided
          in connection with your access and use of the Interfaces and any App is for informational purposes only and
          should not be construed as professional advice. You should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based
          on any information contained on the Interfaces or any App, or any other information that we make available at
          any time, including, without limitation, blog posts, articles, links to third-party content, Discord content,
          news feeds, tutorials, social media content, and videos. Before you make any financial, legal, or other
          decisions involving the Products or information available therein, you should seek independent professional
          advice from an individual who is licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be
          appropriate. The Terms are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. You
          further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in these Terms.
          None of the information provided on the Interfaces, any other App, or through any of the Products, or through
          any other means, shall be interpreted as an invitation or inducement to (i) exercise any rights to acquire,
          dispose of, underwrite, or convert any crypto assets or digital assets or (ii) buy, sell, or induce a user to
          buy or sell any crypto assets or digital assets. Neither the Company nor UMA is acting as an investment
          adviser, trading, tax, legal or other adviser to any person or entity.

              system (such as market manipulation, or exploiting bugs for unfair gain, or insider collusion) may result
              in community or legal action against you. The rules of other platforms, prohibit, for example, market
              manipulation and insider collusion in their prediction markets; similarly, UMA expects users to uphold

          Likewise, you are solely responsible for any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions
          by you in connection with or as a result of your wallet being compromised. Risk Labs does not act as an agent

          using any of our Products, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws
          and regulations that may apply to you.
        </P>
        <P>
          Specifically, your use of our Products or the UMA protocol may result in various tax consequences, such as
          income or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain jurisdictions.
        </P>
        <P>
          It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if
          so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.
        </P>
        <H3>4.4 Gas Fees and Price Estimates</H3>
        <P>
          Blockchain transactions require the payment of transaction fees to the appropriate network (&quot;Gas
          Fees&quot;). Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the terms of another offer by Risk Labs, you will be
          solely responsible to pay the Gas Fees for any transaction that you initiate via any of our Products. Although
          we attempt to provide accurate fee information, this information reflects our estimates of fees, which may
          vary from the actual fees paid to use the Products and interact with the Ethereum blockchain and other
          blockchains.
        </P>
        <H3>4.5 Release of Claims</H3>
        <P>
          You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of any of our Products.
          You further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages
          arising from or in any way relating to your use of any of our Products. If you are a California resident, you
          waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: &quot;[a] general release
          does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her
          favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected
          his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.&quot;
        </P>

        <H2>5. Suspension and Termination of Access</H2>
        <P>
          Risk Labs reserves the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Interfaces at
          any time, with or without prior notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that:
        </P>
        <Ul>
          <Li>
            You have violated these Terms (for example, by engaging in a prohibited activity or misrepresenting your
            eligibility);
          </Li>
          <Li>
            Your use of the Interfaces is unlawful or poses unacceptable legal risk to Risk Labs or the UMA community;
          </Li>
          <Li>
            You are identified as or suspected to be a Sanctioned Person, to be a party present in a Restricted
            Territory, or are using the Interfaces to engage with or on behalf of a Sanctioned Person or party present
            in a Restricted Territory;
          </Li>
          <Li>
            You have attempted to circumvent any technical controls or restrictions on the Interfaces (e.g. using a VPN
            to bypass region blocks);
          </Li>
          <Li>
            It is necessary to protect the security of the UMA protocol or other users (for instance, we may temporarily
            suspend access to address technical attacks or vulnerabilities).
          </Li>
        </Ul>
        <P>
          If possible (and permitted by applicable law), Risk Labs may provide you with notice of such
          termination/suspension and, in some cases, an opportunity to appeal or clarify the issue. However, we are
          under no obligation to do so. During any suspension, you may be blocked from accessing the Products and/or
          interacting with UMA via our Interfaces. Note that because UMA is decentralized, even if your front-end access
          is blocked, the smart contracts themselves may remain accessible via other means – it is your responsibility
          not to violate these Terms by accessing the UMA protocol through alternative methods if your access has been
          suspended or terminated.
        </P>
        <P>
          Risk Labs shall not be liable to you for any losses that result from our termination or suspension of your
          access to the Interfaces. If you believe your access was wrongfully restricted, please contact us (see Section
          13), but Risk Labs&apos; retains final authority to decide such matters.
        </P>
        <P>
          Lastly, you are free to stop using the Interfaces at any time. You may simply discontinue accessing the
          Interfaces. Because no user accounts are held by Risk Labs (access is via your own crypto wallet), termination
          on your side is straightforward – you can disconnect your wallet and cease visiting to the Interfaces or using
          the Products at any time. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (such as
          disclaimers of liability and indemnities) will continue to apply even after you stop using the Interfaces or
          after termination by us.
        </P>

        <H2>6. Third-Party Software, Services, and Integrations</H2>
        <P>
          The UMA Interfaces may contain links or integrations to third-party content or services that are not owned or
          controlled by Risk Labs. For example:
        </P>
        <Ul>
          <Li>
            You might follow a link from our Interfaces to documentation, information, blog posts, or community forums
            hosted on external domains.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            The Interfaces might integrate with wallet providers (like MetaMask or WalletConnect) to enable login and
            transactions – these providers are third-party services.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            Other decentralized applications (dApps) or platforms – such as prediction markets – may use UMA&apos;s
            Network in their own products, or you might use UMA&apos;s Network data in conjunction with other DeFi
            protocols.
          </Li>
        </Ul>
        <P>
          Any third-party services or content that you access via links or in conjunction with UMA are subject to those
          third parties&apos; terms and privacy policies, not these Terms. Risk Labs does not have control over and does
          not endorse or assume any responsibility for any third-party sites, information, products, or services. If,
          for example, you use UMA&apos;s Network or Interfaces, via or in relation to another platform Risk Labs is not
          liable for any of your interactions or engagements with that platform, or the performance, operation, or
          outcomes of that platform. Similarly, support or integration of UMA with a particular application, blockchain,
          or token does not constitute an endorsement of that project, and we make no guarantee of its safety or
          legality.
        </P>
        <P>
          You acknowledge that interactions with third-party services (including smart contracts not maintained by Risk
          Labs) are solely between you and the third party. Risk Labs shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of
          any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. This includes, but is not limited to, for instance,
          losses arising from:
        </P>
        <Ul>
          <Li>
            A third-party smart contract or platform using incorrect UMA Network data or misinterpreting the
            Network&apos;s outcome.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            Security failures or hacks of a third-party dApp that affect your use of UMA, the Network, or the
            Interfaces.
          </Li>
        </Ul>
        <P>
          Any content you view that is provided by third parties, or any agreements you enter with third parties (such
          as betting on a prediction market), are outside the scope of these Terms, and you should familiarize yourself
          with any terms and conditions associated with those interfaces or products.
        </P>
        <P>
          We encourage you to review any third-party&apos;s terms and conditions and privacy policies before using their
          services. Your use of the UMA protocol through any interface (ours or others&apos;) is at your own risk, and
          you must understand the risks of interacting with smart contracts and decentralized platforms. Risk Labs does
          not generally monitor or audit third-party services that may use UMA, and we make no representations as to
          their compliance or reliability.
        </P>
        <P>
          We make no warranties or representations, express or implied, about linked third party services, the third
          parties they are owned and operated by, the information contained on them, assets available through them, or
          the suitability, privacy, or security of their products or services. You acknowledge sole responsibility for
          and assume all risk arising from your use of third-party services, third-party websites, applications, or
          resources.
        </P>
        <P>
          Neither the Company nor UMA is responsible for the operation of the underlying blockchain network, and neither
          the Company nor UMA makes any guarantee of the underlying blockchain network&apos;s functionality, security,
          or availability. The Company has no ability in any way to control, maintain, provide, operate, or improve the
          blockchain network underlying the UMA protocol nor the activity or data thereon. The Company is not
          responsible for the activities of persons or entities who develop or use applications or who validate or
          verify transactions or other operations related to blockchain networks operated by third parties. The Company
          cannot control how blockchain networks operated by third parties market their blockchain networks and users
          should not assume any blockchain networks operated by third parties are affiliated with the Company or UMA.
          All transactions broadcast to the applicable blockchain network via your Wallet may require the payment of
          non-refundable network transaction fees, which shall be borne entirely by you. We do not effectuate,
          facilitate or control any transactions initiated via the Platform, and the Company will not be responsible for
          the result of any transactions, including but not limited to failed, inadvertent, or fraudulent transactions
          that may result in loss of funds or assets or transaction fees or any other loss or harm to you.
        </P>

        <H2>7. Disclaimers of Warranties</H2>
        <H3>7.1 Assumption of Risk- Generally</H3>
        <P>
          Risk labs is a developer of software. Risk Labs does not operate a digital asset or derivatives exchange
          platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and has no oversight, involvement, or control
          concerning your transactions using the products. All transactions between users of the interface are executed
          peer-to-peer directly between the users&apos; addresses through a smart contract. You are responsible for
          complying with all applicable laws that govern your digital assets.
        </P>
        <P>
          By accessing and using any of our products, you represent that you are financially and technically
          sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based
          systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as ether
          (eth), so-called stablecoins, and other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum token standard
          (erc-20). You acknowledge and understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and
          blockchain-based networks. Risk Labs does not own or control any of the underlying software through which
          blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, including the
          Ethereum blockchain, is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the
          products, you acknowledge and agree (a) that Risk Labs is not responsible for the operation of the
          blockchain-based software and networks underlying the products, (b) that there exists no guarantee of the
          functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (c) that the underlying
          blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to
          as &quot;forks,&quot; which may materially affect the products. Blockchain networks use public and private key
          cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your
          private key(s). Losing control of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to
          digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain or other blockchain-based networks. Neither Risk Labs nor any other
          person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your digital assets. If your private key(s) are lost,
          then you will not be able to transfer your digital assets to any other blockchain address or wallet. If this
          occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value or utility from the digital assets that you may hold.
        </P>
        <P>
          Further, you acknowledge and understand that the markets for these digital assets are nascent and highly
          volatile due to risk factors including, but not limited to, adoption, speculation, technology, security, and
          regulation. You understand that anyone can create a digital asset, including fake versions of existing tokens
          and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and understand the risk that you may
          mistakenly engage with those or other tokens. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to
          be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs.
        </P>
        <P>
          Further, you acknowledge and understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and
          that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and understand that you
          are responsible for all actions and transactions you carry out in connection with our Products, including any
          erroneous actions. We do not take any action to resolve erroneous actions that result from your errors. You
          acknowledge and understand that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based
          systems such as Ethereum are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.
        </P>
        <P>
          Further, you acknowledge and understand that the products and your digital assets could be impacted by one or
          more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Risk Labs to
          continue to make available our proprietary software and could impede or limit your ability to access or use
          the products.
        </P>
        <P>
          Further, you acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code
          cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present
          risks to digital assets and the products, and could result in the theft or loss of your digital assets. To the
          extent possible, the smart contracts available on the interface will be updated to account for any advances in
          cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from
          technological advancements, but that intention does not guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the
          products.
        </P>
        <P>
          Further, you understand that the Ethereum blockchain and other blockchain-based networks remain under
          development, which creates technological and security risks when using the products in addition to uncertainty
          relating to digital assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the
          Ethereum blockchain and other blockchain-based networks is variable and may increase at any time causing
          impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain or other blockchain-based networks, which may
          result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the products.
        </P>
        <P>
          Further, you acknowledge and understand that the products are subject to flaws and that you are solely
          responsible for evaluating any code provided relating to the products. This warning and other warnings that
          Risk Labs provides in these terms are in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of
          the potential risks of utilizing the products. Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information
          and data on the interface and during your use of the products, the interface and other information available
          when using the products may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include
          technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate
          information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including
          information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you acknowledge and understand that you should verify all
          information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the interface or as part
          of the products are your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or
          appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the site or otherwise
          when using the products. Prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on
          platforms providing similar services.
        </P>
        <P>
          We must comply with applicable laws, which may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take
          certain actions or provide information. You acknowledge and understand that Risk Labs may in its sole
          discretion take any action it deems appropriate to cooperate with government agencies or comply with
          applicable laws.
        </P>
        <P>
          Further you acknowledge we do not warrant that any data, content, or information provided through the
          Interfaces (including oracle outcomes, prices, or values) is accurate, reliable, or correct. All information
          is provided for general information purposes and use of the Network&apos;s output is at your own risk. We make
          no guarantees that the UMA Network&apos;s results will meet your expectations or requirements, or that they
          will be free from errors (human or software errors). Risk Labs does not guarantee that the Interfaces will be
          available at any given time or free from interruption. We cannot guarantee that access will be continuous,
          timely, secure, or error-free. Because these services depend on complex decentralized networks (blockchains)
          and third-party infrastructure, there may be delays, downtime, or technical issues outside our control. You
          acknowledge that blockchain transactions can be delayed or fail due to network issues, and the Interfaces may
          be suspended for maintenance, to address security concerns, or for other reasons. We expressly disclaim any
          implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. For
          example, we do not guarantee that using the UMA protocol will achieve any particular outcome for you,
          financial or otherwise, or that the protocol is suitable for any specific use case.
        </P>
        <P>
          You are solely responsible for familiarizing yourself with your Wallet and its safety and security features,
          including any private keys and passwords associated therewith. We cannot and will not access your private key,
          password, or any crypto assets held within your Wallet and we cannot and will not we reverse any transactions
          you initiate with your Wallet (or otherwise). We are not responsible or liable in any way for how you use your
          Wallet.
        </P>
        <P>
          You should also familiarize yourself with the risks associated with transacting on blockchain networks,
          including but not limited to smart contract vulnerabilities, front end vulnerabilities, hacks, phishing
          attacks, social engineering attacks, crypto assets volatility and transaction irreversibility.
        </P>
        <P>
          In summary, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or
          control the UMA protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while
          accessing or using any of the Products. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility
          for all of the risks of accessing and using the interface to interact with the UMA protocol. You hereby
          irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Risk Labs and
          our shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, suppliers, and
          contractors related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 7 or elsewhere in these Terms.
        </P>
        <P>
          Risk Disclosure: By using UMA, you acknowledge the following specific risks, for which Risk Labs bears no
          responsibility:
        </P>
        <Ul>
          <Li>
            You may lose digital assets in the course of engagement with the UMA protocol or related DeFi applications.
            For instance, if you post a bond on UMA&apos;s Network and a dispute arises, you might lose that bond based
            on the outcome of a vote. Outcomes are decided by UMA token holder governance, and there is no guarantee of
            the result.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            Markets and other contracts using UMA&apos;s oracle data can be unpredictable. Risk Labs is not responsible
            for any financial losses (trading losses, liquidity issues, or any other form of financial loss) you may
            suffer by relying on UMA&apos;s network for any decision or transaction.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            The value of any crypto asset can be volatile. Risk Labs does not guarantee the market performance of any
            token.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            There may be regulatory or legal uncertainty around using decentralized oracle data for certain purposes
            (such as prediction markets). You are responsible for understanding how the law applies to you and for any
            consequences of your use of UMA in a given jurisdiction. Risk Labs is not responsible for any costs, and
            disclaims any liability, for regulatory actions or penalties imposed on you by authorities due to your use
            of the UMA protocol.
          </Li>
        </Ul>
        <P>
          The above list is illustrative and is not comprehensive. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
          certain warranties. Nothing in these Terms will exclude or limit any warranty or right that may not be
          lawfully excluded or limited under applicable law. But in such cases, UMA&apos;s liability will be limited to
          the minimum extent permitted by law.
        </P>
        <H3>7.2 No Investment Advice</H3>
        <P>
          You agree and understand that all actions you take in connection with any of our Products are considered
          unsolicited, which means that they are solely initiated by you. All information provided by any of our
          Products is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or a
          recommendation that a particular token is a safe or sound investment. You should not take, or refrain from
          taking, any action based on any information contained in any of our Products. By providing information for
          your convenience, we do not make any investment recommendations to you or opine on the merits of any
          transaction or opportunity. You alone are responsible for determining whether any investment, investment
          strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial
          circumstances, and risk tolerance.
        </P>

        <H2>8. Limitation of Damages and Liability</H2>
        <P>
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Risk Labs or its affiliates, officers,
          directors, employees, or agents be liable to you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special,
          consequential, exemplary damages, or the following types of loss or damage arising out of or in connection
          with your use of (or inability to use) the UMA Products, Network, or protocol, whether such damages are based
          in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and even if we have been advised of or should
          have known of the possibility of the loss or damage:

            <strong>Indirect or Consequential Losses:</strong> This includes any indirect, incidental, special,
            exemplary, or consequential damages; for example, damages for lost profits, lost revenues, lost
            opportunities, business interruption, loss of data, or loss of goodwill or other intangible property.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            <strong>Technology and Security Losses:</strong> Any loss resulting from hacking, tampering, or other
            unauthorized access to or use of the UMA protocol or Products or your account, or any security breaches or
            technical failures. (For instance, if your private key is stolen and someone misuses it on UMA, or if
            there&apos;s an exploit in a smart contract you interact with, Risk Labs is not liable.)
          </Li>
          <Li>
            <strong>Financial Losses:</strong> Any diminution in value of any cryptocurrency or asset, or any loss of
            virtual currency or digital assets, that occurs through using UMA. This also covers losses from oracle
            resolutions you disagree with, or smart contract defaults, for example, if you used UMA&apos;s oracle in a
            financial contract and the outcome causes you financial harm, you cannot hold Risk Labs responsible for that
            result.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            <strong>User Mistakes:</strong> Losses caused by your own errors or misuse, such as sending cryptocurrency
            to the wrong address, losing your private keys, or making a bad trading decision based on UMA data.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            <strong>Third-Party Acts:</strong> Any damages or losses arising from actions or omissions of third parties
            (including other users, validators, data providers, or integrated platforms). Risk Labs does not guarantee
            and is not liable for the behavior of independent UMA token holders or other participants in the oracle
            process, even if their actions (like how they vote or any alleged collusion) affect you.
          </Li>
        </Ul>
        <P>
          In jurisdictions where limitation of liability for certain damages is not allowed, our liability is limited to
          the greatest extent permitted by law.
        </P>
        <P>
          <strong>Cap on Liability:</strong> To the extent any liability of Risk Labs is not entirely disclaimed and is
          proven in a court of law or other authority, the maximum aggregate liability of Risk Labs and its affiliates
          arising out of these Terms or your use of the Interfaces will not exceed USD $100 (one hundred U.S. dollars)
          or the equivalent in local currency. If applicable law does not allow such a cap on liability, we will limit
          our liability to the smallest amount permitted by law.
        </P>
        <P>
          You acknowledge that Risk Labs is offering access to a free, open-source protocol and experimental technology.
          By using the Products, you accept that you have no monetary or legal remedy against Risk Labs or associated
          parties for issues beyond this limited scope. Your primary remedy for dissatisfaction with the Products or UMA
          protocol is to stop using them.
        </P>
        <P>The foregoing disclaimer will not apply to the extent prohibited by law.</P>

        <H2>9. Indemnification</H2>
        <P>
          You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees,
          contractors, agents, affiliates, and subsidiaries (collectively &quot;Indemnified Parties&quot;) from and
          against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your
          access and use of any of our Products; (b) your violation of any term or condition of this Agreement, the
          right of any third party, or any other applicable law, rule, or regulation; (c) any other party&apos;s access
          and use of any of our Products with your assistance or using any device or account that you own or control;
          (d) digital assets associated with your wallet; (e) your infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of
          the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of any other person or entity; and (f) any dispute
          between you and (i) any other user of any of the Products or (ii) any of your own customers or users. If you
          are obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party, Risk Labs (or, at our sole discretion, the applicable
          Indemnified Party) will have the right, in our or its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and
          to determine whether Risk Labs wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you agree to cooperate with
          Risk Labs in the defense.
        </P>

        <H2>10. Changes to the Terms</H2>
        <P>
          Risk Labs may revise or update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our operations or legal
          obligations. Whenever we make a material change to these Terms, we will post the updated version on our
          website (and update the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at the top). It is your responsibility to review the
          Terms.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you continue to use the Products after changes to the Terms take effect, you thereby accept the revised
          Terms. If you do not agree with any modifications, you must stop using the Products. We may, at our
          discretion, also announce significant changes via other channels (such as community forums or social media),
          but you should not rely on personal notice.
        </P>
        <P>
          No Risk Labs employee or agent has the authority to alter or waive any part of these Terms except by official
          publication of an updated version; any informal communications that attempt to modify these Terms cannot be
          relied upon.
        </P>

        <H2>11. Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, and Class Action Waivers</H2>
        <H3>11.1 Governing Law</H3>
        <P>
          You agree that the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, govern
          this Agreement and any Dispute between you and us; provided, that the foregoing shall not restrict us from
          seeking remedies for disputes related to the violation of any intellectual property rights in the United
          States Patent and Trademark Office, Trademark Trial and Appeal Board or any other similar office or court of
          competent jurisdiction. You further agree that each of our Products shall be deemed to be based solely in the
          State of New York, and that although a Product may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does
          not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the State of New York. The
          parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this
          Section 11 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et
          seq. (the &quot;FAA&quot;), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Any arbitration conducted
          pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the FAA. You agree that the federal and state courts of New
          York County, New York are the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in
          the event that this Agreement&apos;s binding arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.
        </P>
        <P>
          If any portion of this Section 11 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the
          unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or
          unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 11 or the parties&apos;
          ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 11; and (c) to
          the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative
          basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and
          the parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims
          in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 11 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking
          public injunctive relief, then that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be
          sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 11 will be enforceable.
        </P>
        <H3>11.2 Dispute Resolution</H3>
        <P>
          We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good faith negotiations. If a
          potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to legal@umaproject.org so that we can
          attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren&apos;t able to reach an
          informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve the potential
          dispute according to the process set forth below.
        </P>
        <P>
          Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to any of our Products, this Agreement, or any other acts
          or omissions for which you may contend that we are liable, including, but not limited to, any claim or
          controversy as to arbitrability (&quot;Dispute&quot;), shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration
          under the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures. You understand that you are required to resolve all
          Disputes by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be held on a confidential basis before a single
          arbitrator, who shall be selected pursuant to JAMS rules. The arbitration will be held in New York, New York,
          unless you and we both agree to hold it elsewhere. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
          consolidate your claims with those of any other party. You and Risk Labs agree that for any arbitration you
          initiate, you will pay the filing fee and all other JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Risk
          Labs, Risk Labs will pay all JAMS fees and costs.
        </P>
        <P>
          Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Products must be filed within one (1) year after
          such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Risk Labs will not have
          the right to assert the claim.
        </P>
        <P>
          Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
          for any reason a claim by law or equity must proceed in court rather than in arbitration you agree to waive
          any right to a jury trial and any claim may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a New York state
          court located in New York County, New York.
        </P>
        <H3>11.3 Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver</H3>
        <P>
          You and Risk Labs agree that any Dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service is personal to
          you and Risk Labs You must bring any and all Disputes against us in your individual capacity and not as a
          plaintiff in or member of any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or
          other representative proceeding. This provision applies to class arbitration.
        </P>
        <P>Except as specified above, you and we both agree to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.</P>

        <H2>12. Miscellaneous</H2>
        <H3>12.1 Entire Agreement</H3>
        <P>
          These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
          Agreement supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements, communications and
          other understandings (if any) relating to the subject matter of the Terms.
        </P>
        <H3>12.2 Assignment</H3>
        <P>
          You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written
          consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this Agreement without our prior written consent shall be
          null and void. We may freely assign or transfer this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will
          bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
        </P>
        <H3>12.3 Rewards</H3>
        <P>
          In connection with your historic or current use of one or more of our Products, we may provide you certain
          incentives, prizes or rewards for completing certain activities, such as completing a certain number of
          transactions (&quot;User Rewards&quot;). Details regarding the criteria for earning a reward will be described
          within the applicable Product or official Risk Labs documentation. Upon satisfaction of the criteria for
          obtaining a reward and subject to your compliance with the associated rewards terms, this Agreement, and
          applicable law — to be determined exclusively by Risk Labs — we will use commercially reasonable efforts to
          promptly transfer the earned reward to the digital wallet that you designate or have connected to the
          applicable Product. We reserve the right to change, modify, discontinue or cancel any rewards programs
          (including the frequency and criteria for earning such User Rewards), at any time and without notice to you.
        </P>
        <H3>12.4 Not Registered with the SEC or Any Other Agency</H3>
        <P>
          We are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange or in
          any other capacity. You understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on your behalf. We
          also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your trades, which occur entirely on public distributed
          blockchains like Ethereum. As a result, we do not (and cannot) guarantee market best pricing or best execution
          through our Products. Any references in a Product to &quot;best price&quot; does not constitute a
          representation or warranty about pricing available through such Product, on the UMA protocol, or elsewhere.
        </P>
        <H3>12.5. Notice</H3>
        <P>
          We may provide any notice to you under this Agreement using commercially reasonable means, including using
          public communication channels. Notices we provide by using public communication channels will be effective
          upon posting.
        </P>
        <H3>12.6 Rights and Remedies</H3>
        <P>
          Any right or remedy of Risk Labs set forth in these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
          right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under applicable laws, at law, or in equity. The failure or
          delay of Risk Labs in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver
          thereof.
        </P>
        <H3>12.7 Severability</H3>
        <P>
          If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or
          regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted
          to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the
          validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall not be affected.
        </P>
